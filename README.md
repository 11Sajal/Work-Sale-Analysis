# Sales Analysis Dashboard
In my Work Sale Analysis project, I used Excel to create dashboards and tables for data analysis. The process involved data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization. I utilized macros for automation, DAX formulas for calculations, and pivot tables for dynamic data summaries to drive insights and decision-making.
